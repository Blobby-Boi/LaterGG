### Guide for fullscreening and bypassing the now.gg time limit. Based on "now.gg topup limit bypass" from TN Discord.

1. Open this link: `https://now.gg/apps/a/19900/b.html?ng_ntmSource=MyGames&ng_ifp_partner=latergg`. You should see now.gg load into Roblox but in fullscreen mode.
2. Once it loads, click privacy and scroll down to where it says COPPA<br>
